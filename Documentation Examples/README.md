## About the project setup

In order to make getting started with the examples in this project as easy as
possible we have decided to integrate Quick and Nimble using
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/), and to track the `Pods/` folder under Git.

There are differente school of thoughts on this approach, and you can read
about them
[here](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control).

Read the discussion in [this pull
request](https://github.com/Quick/Wiki/pull/1) for more context on the choices
behind the setup of this example project.
